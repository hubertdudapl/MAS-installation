# MAS Manage installation 
The purpose of the project is to provide a quick and effective tutorial on how to install MAS Manage (bare-metal, within reasonable hardware requirements), capitalizing on already existing sources and assets. It was created ad-hoc, so it is what it is ;-).  
It covers:
- [OpenShift](doc/ocp.md)
- [MAS Core](doc/core.md)
- [MAS Manage](doc/manage.md)
